# Grading

## Postman Setup

The postman collection has been modified and can be run from either `localhost:8082` or the Elastic Beanstalk instance, depending on the variable `HOST` defined the collection.

## Elastic Beanstalk Info

EB URL: http://udafilter-dev-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

## Git Structure

The branches `feat-xxx` are set up for development work. As this repo serves a development application, the `master` branch acts as the main branch for development.

The relevant branch for grading can be found in `feat-filter`. This has been merged into the `master` branch as of submission time.
